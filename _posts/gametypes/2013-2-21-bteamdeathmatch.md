### Team Deathmatch

##### Setup

Players begin with a set number of lives, generally 3 or 5, sometimes 1 if the game is proceed quicker and be
a bit more intense.
Players are divided into at least 2 teams, each with a set respawn point. After being assigned to a team,
players are to proceed to their (re)spawn point.

##### Gameplay

Upon blowing a whistle and/or the moderator finishing a countdown, game begins.
Players leave their spawn point and attack the other team. Lives are lost upon a successful hit being scored by
an enemy player. When one team is out of lives, they are removed from the game. 
The last team with living players remaining wins.

### Prison

Similar to Team Deathmatch, with a small difference - there is no set number of lives. 
Tagged players immediately go to the opposing teams &quot;prison&quot;, an area in which they must stand
until they are &quot;freed&quot; by a teammate. Freeing a teammate involves touching them.
Upon being &quot;freed&quot;, players must *immediately* go to their team's respawn point to continue playing;
during this time they are invulnerable to enemy fire.
Game ends when all players of a team are in prison.

### Wingman

Variant of Team Deathmatch.

Players begin with one life and are divided into pairs, each with a set respawn point. 
After being assigned to a pair, players are to proceed to their (re)spawn point.
Game ends when only one team remains.
