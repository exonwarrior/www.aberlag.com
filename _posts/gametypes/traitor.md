### Traitor

##### Setup and Objectives

At the start of the game, a small number of Traitors are chosen, and made aware of each other.
Their aim is to murder all of the Innocents. The aim of everyone else - the Innocents - is to remain alive until
no Traitors are left alive. 

Traitors win after eliminating all innocents within a set time limit, 
otherwise the innocents are victorious. 

##### Gameplay

Players disperse after the moderators blows a whistle and/or finishes a countdown.

Traitors attempt to kill innocents, either sneakily to avoid revealing themselves, or via standard run-n-gun methods.

### Mafia

##### Setup and Objectives

At the start of the game, a small number of Mafia members are chosen, and made aware of each other.
Their aim is to murder all of the Innocents.
 
The aim of everyone else - the Innocents - is to remain alive until no members of the Mafia are left alive.

They can do this by acting as a vigilante and murdering them during the Night,
or by voting to have them arrested during the Day.

##### Gameplay

The game cycles through Night and Day, starting with the Night. 
A moderator will blow a whistle to mark the start of each Night and Day.
 
** Night **

During the Night, the Mafia must try and eliminate the Innocents - this lasts around 5 minutes, 
or until the players stop moving.
 
** Day **

During the Day, the players gather together and vote to execute those people they think are members of the Mafia. 
There is a ceasefire during the Day.
 
Any player at the gathering may make a single nomination of another player, 
and the players then do a show of hands (with the majority winning) to decide whether to execute that player. 
Once no players can make or want to make a nomination, the Night starts.
 
At the end of the Day, the moderator announces the remaining number of Mafia members.
