AberLAG runs 'shootouts' regularly on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. There is normally an event page on the Facebook group describing the event location and time (at least 4 days in advance, or 2 during periods where the weather is unpredictable) - if there isn't contact the Events Manager (Dave Haenze) or the committee.
 
### Moderating
 
Any member (both paid and non-paid) can help with moderation during shootouts, and run or help with matches. Shootouts will list the members that plan on attending and moderating on the event page. If you want to moderate for a shootout, contact the event organiser or the Events Manager and have your name added to the list of people who will be moderating the event.

### Other Shootouts
  
Members may organise their own shootouts, but they always have to follow the [AberLAG safety rules](/rules/), or the alternate set of safety rules (which will be made available soon).
