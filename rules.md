### Safety

First are the safety rules. These are important, and breaking them may get you banned from the society.

- **Listen to the moderators**
  <br/> Follow their instructions - especially at the start of games.
- **No physical contact**
  <br/> Don't push, shove or grab at other players. 
  <br/> *HvZ is slightly different as it involves tagging other people via touch, but don't go barrelling into people.*
- **Be aware of your environment**
  <br/> Don't climb on walls (or anything else you could fall from) or otherwise endanger yourself, or other people.
- **Don't use realistic looking blasters**
  <br/> All equipment (in particular, blasters) must not look realistic or be painted in dark colours, and must have orange tips.
  <br/> *Modified or unusual blasters must be checked with the Safety Officer - they must not hurt on impact or have potential to cause injury.*
- **Act sensibly**
  <br/> It may not be covered by the rules. But if could cause danger to another player, or get the game banned: *don't do it*.

### Tagging and Equipment

You can tag another player by shooting them with a blaster, touching them with a melee weapon, or hitting them with a thrown weapon.

When tagging another player, you should call &quot;**HIT**&quot; to ensure the other player notices that they have been tagged.

- **Foam dart/disc blasters**
  <br/> Players are tagged by a direct hit from a projectile. Hits to the feet or blaster do not count.
- **Thrown weapons**
  <br/> Rolled up socks or soft beanbags are used as thrown weapons, and tag players in the same way as blasters.
- **Melee weapons**
  <br/> LARP-style melee weapons tag a player simply by touching them.
  <br/> *Players using melee weapons must have permission from both the current Safety Officer and the current moderator.*

*[direct hit]: The projectile hitting the player or the players equipment and coming to a full stop.

### Etiquette

Shootouts and other events may be competitive, but they are still a game. Respect the other players, and play fairly.

- **Act with honour, integrity and sportsmanship**
  <br/> Don't cheat, ignore the moderators, or attempt to spoil the game for the other players.
- **Dead men don't talk**
  <br/> Inactive (&quot;dead&quot;) players should not interfere with players who are still active.
  <br/> To signify that you are inactive, hold up your hand(s) or your weapon in the air.
- **Owners**
  <br/> Mark your blasters, clips, ammunition and any other items you use in-game.
  <br/> Make sure that darts and other equipment are collected at the end of shootouts, and equipment is returned to its owners.
  <br/> It's fine to use marked darts during a game, as long as they are returned to the owners at the end of the game.

### Punishment

The rules are enforced via a card-based system.

- **First offense**
  <br/> Breaking a rule results in a verbal warning being issued.
- **Second offense**
  <br/> Breaking the rules for a second time will result in a yellow card being issued and the rule-breaker shall be immediately removed from the event (shootout, etc).
- **Third offense**
  <br/> Third rule break results in a red card being given and the member in question being banned for varying amounts of time (dependant on severity). 

The Committee reserves the right to determine the appropriate length of the ban, up to and including a permanent ban from the society and all its events.
