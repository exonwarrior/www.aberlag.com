The {{ site.title }} runs live-action competitive combat games, using foam dart blasters and socks.
We run weekly 'shootouts', as well as tournaments and massive events such as [Humans Vs Zombies](http://humansvszombies.org/). We aim to provide a fun, safe and welcoming environment for all players - from those that just want to play for fun, to the more serious tournament players.

The society was founded in 2011 by a group of friends with a love of playing with Nerf blasters, who wanted to take it beyond their small group into something bigger. Now we have a group with a much larger number of members and hope to expand our reach to this year's students, both new and returning. In October 2012 we ran our second Humans Vs Zombies event, followed by a day game called Red vs Blue vs Zombies in February 2013. Our next big event will be Red vs Blue in March 2013 - more information on this will be released soon.

If you're interested in participating in one of the most unique societies Aberystwyth University has to offer, join us at one of our weekly shootouts to get a feel for the games we run and talk to the members who play regularly - don't worry if you don't have a blaster, our members are friendly and willing to loan equipment to others. You can also talk to us on our <a class="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aberlag/">facebook group</a>, or contact [the committee](/committee/).
